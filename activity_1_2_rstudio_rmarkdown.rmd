## Answers to Ex. 1
There are 1846 rows and 3 columns. The three variables are  mean, standard deviation, and Pearson's correlation.

## Answer to Ex 2.
The shape is of, most likely, a type of allosaur.  Calculating the r-value is not pertinent.

## Answer to Ex 3.
It looks like a star. The r-value is -.063. I chose not to find the r-value for dino.

## Answer to Ex 4.
It is the same value as the previous star shape and only slightly different than the dino.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
